# Building my website: Day 03
Today, I had a smooth developing experience, everything being completed successfully, and I felt not that exhausted. :)
*Let me list what I did today!*

### Designing the layout for the home page
Largely, I used flex layout to design my website.

### Constructor the server
The server is currently used for uploading my blogs.
It'll have much more functionalities later!
